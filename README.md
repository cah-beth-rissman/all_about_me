### Reflections and Comments
* Class 02 Learning Journal
  * Working to understand CSS ids and classes.
  * I enjoy learning JavaScript.
  * I do not enjoy styling. I have no patience for colors and arrangement on a page.
  * The developer tools contain much useful information and is a great place to learn about the box model and play with styling.
  * Testing out JS in the console is a great learning tool to gain understanding and test out code while learning.
  * It's very humbling to show your code to the class, but a good way to learn togther and get better.
